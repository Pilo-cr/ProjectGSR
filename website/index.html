            <p>
                I started the investigation process by brainstorming different projects I could do that would help enhance a person's well-being.
                I considered an alarm that would go off when you moved your phone to reduce screen time, cultivating plants from home to help people relax, and finally the idea I decided to go with which was an analysis of sweat on skin that could let you know when you're getting stressed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I investigated which sensor I could use to carry the project the only one that I could find that would be useful was the galvanic skin response sensor (GSR).
                This sensor records electrical activity in the skin, which is due to variation of moisture level in the body due to sweating. <br>

                The sensor measures the varying levels of the skin conducting the electric current.
                Higher levels of perspiration on the skin leads to a greater conductance of electrical currents.
                A higher level of skin conductivity after an event can be interpreted as emotional arousal.
                I will be interpreting this as an increase of stress level.
                Then this could be used to enhance their well-being as the person can know when they're getting stressed and know what to avoid doing or know when to take a break from whatever activity they may be doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I carried out interviews with my friends and family to see if they would be interested in a product like this.
                The outcome was very positive, they all said they would be very interested in being able to view their emotional changes towards different tasks such as movies, so I made sure to include a way to actively view the changes.
                I also asked if they would be bothered by wearing the sensor on their fingers over long periods of times, but they seemed okay with it.
                Another thing I asked that I considered when creating the code was in which way they would like to view the values.
                They wanted it to be easy to see the changes.

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="planANDdesign-tab-pane" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="planANDdesign-tab" tabindex="0">
            <p>
                First checked to see what the requirements were and how I would meet them:
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Basic Requirements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a fully automated embedded system that utilises digital/analogue inputs and
                        digital/analogue outputs to support the theme of well-being.</li>
                    <li>Validate and store the data gathered from the embedded system.</li>
                    <li>Create an analysis component that can be used to calculate or predict certain information and
                        inform future decisions relating to well-being.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Advanced Requirements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using Python, create a computer model based on your own created dataset of well-being data or one that you have sourced externally.
                        Your personal dataset could be generated manually, programmatically or by the embedded system.
                        The dataset should be capable of answering a minimum of two ‘what if’ type questions which you will need to devise yourself. </li>
                    <li>Each ‘what if’ question must use a minimum of three validated parameters (using at least two
                        different data types) and, based on the information provided, offer the user insights in relation
                        to some aspect of their well-being.</li>
                    <li>Users can view data in a graphical format which displays information such as their progress
                        using the system or the results of a ‘what if’ scenario. </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                To meet the these requirements, I created a piece of coding using the language C++ and uploaded it into an Arduino.
                This takes the reading from the GSR sensor, an analogue input.
                Then, through python I created a program that takes in the information from the Arduino and stores it in a CSV file.
                I made the information be displayed in a graph form (graphical format) which would change colours according to the stress level.
                As well as that, it displays the average stress level throughout the time running and plays a warning noise when you reach high stress level.
                The average stress level can help the user by informing them on whether the activity they have done made them stressed or calm and they can know if they should avoid doing this activity in the future or not.
            </p>

            <P>
                When I was making my project I took into account some 'what if' situations.
                What if the user is deaf? I made a visual way of knowing when you have reached a high stress level.
                What if the user is blind? There is a warning noise that plays when you have reached a high stress level.
                What if the user do not know how to read the graph? The stress level is written on the screen as it's being read, so they don't need to know how to read graphs.
            </P>

            <p>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Computer to run code on.</li>
                    <li>Arduino which will have C++ code it will run on, it will take in the information and feed it to python code which will act on it.</li>
                    <li>Galvanic Skin Response Sensor.</li>
                    <li>Speaker or Headphones, something to be able to hear the warning sound.</li>
                    <li>Cables used to connect the sensor to the arduino.</li>
                    <li>Visual Studio Code used to code python.</li>

            <p>
                <h4>Problem and Solution</h4>
                A problem that I encountered while creating my project was when I reached the point where I had to create a code to transfer data from the Arduino to python. <br>
                All of the information online was outdated or just did not work in general. <br>
                It was very difficult to find anything that would be helpful, but i noticed a lot of people were using serial library to import information. <br>
                Using the official documentation, I learnt how to use the import of serial and eventually I figured out how to get it working. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>An important piece of code</h4>
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="evaluation-tab-pane" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="evaluation-tab" tabindex="0">

            <p>
                My initial design of the project did not contain all the requirements needed from the project brief. I did not have enough outputs planned, I only had the idea of adding LED lights to the arduino. <br>
                I decided to have all my outputs coded straight onto the python code as it would be less of a hassle to carry around the arduino if it only had one sensor attached to it. <br>
                Thankfully the original design idea didn't need many modifications to get it to meet the requirement and it actually turned out to be a simpler plan then my original one. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                The project meets the needs of the user as I made sure the arduino was comfortable to wear. I did this by no applying the outputs physically to the arduino board. <br>
                I also made the graph simple to read and made it in such a way that the graph moves as new data keeps being recorded. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the future there are a few things that could be improved on. <br>
                Some examples are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently when you have reached a certain stress level the whole graph line changes colour to red. In the future I would like it if the line only changed colour on the section that is higher than the certain level.</li>
                    <li>In the code I have created, the levels that correspond to high stress or low stress are based on my levels that I worked out with multiple trial tests. In the future I would like it if there was a pice of code that, when the user first gets the artifact, it would calculate what level would be high for that specific user. </li>
                    <li>I also would like to have a sound play when you are no longer in the high stress area.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
