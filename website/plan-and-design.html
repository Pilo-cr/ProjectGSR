            <h1>Stress Detector - Project Report</h1>
            <p>This is a Leaving Cert project focused on using technology to help improve the well-being of the user. I have
                made a project that tracks the users stress levels. I did this by using galvanic skin response sensors. </p>

    <h2>Plan and Design</h2>

    <h4>User's Needs</h4>
    <p>

        I made sure to include the feedback from the interviews when designing my project.
        For example my end design only has one sensor attached to the arduino, when originally I was meant to have all my
        outputs on attached to it.
        This shows me taking the users needs into account as they said they would like for the artifact to not be too bulky.
        As well as that, because the interviews let me know people wanted the data to be easily readable, I decided to go
        with a graph to interpret the data.
    </p>

    <h4>What if...</h4>
    <p>

        When creating my project I took into account some 'what if' situations.
        What if the user is deaf? I made a visual way of knowing when you have reached a high stress level.
        What if the user is blind? There is a warning noise that plays when you have reached a high stress level.
        What if the user do not know how to read the graph? The stress level is written on the screen as it's being read, so
        they don't need to know how to read graphs.

    </p>

    <h4>Hardware and Software</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Computer to run code on.</li>
        <li>Arduino which will have C++ code it will run on, it will take in the information and feed it to python code
            which will act on it.
        </li>
        <li>Galvanic Skin Response Sensor.</li>
        <li>Speaker or Headphones, something to be able to hear the warning sound.</li>
        <li>Cables used to connect the sensor to the arduino.</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code used to code python.</li>
        <li>ArduinoID used to code the C++ code.</li>
    </ul>
