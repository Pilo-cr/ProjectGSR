        <h1>Stress Detector - Project Report</h1>
        <p>This is a Leaving Cert project focused on using technology to help improve the well-being of the user. I have made a project that tracks the users stress levels. I did this by using galvanic skin response sensors. </p>

<h2>Investigation</h2>
<div>

    <p>
        I started the investigation process by brainstorming different projects I could do that would help enhance a person's well-being.
        I considered an alarm that would go off when you moved your phone to reduce screen time, cultivating plants from home to help people relax, and finally the idea I decided to go with, which was an analysis of sweat on skin that could let you know when you're getting stressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I investigated which sensor I could use to carry the project the only one that I could find that would be useful was the galvanic skin response sensor (GSR).
        This sensor records electrical activity in the skin, which is due to variation of moisture level in the body due to sweating. <br>

        The sensor measures the varying levels of the skin conducting the electric current.
        Higher levels of perspiration on the skin leads to a greater conductance of electrical currents.
        A higher level of skin conductivity after an event can be interpreted as emotional arousal.
        I will be interpreting this as an increase of stress level.
        Then this could be used to enhance their well-being as the person can know when they're getting stressed and know what to avoid doing or know when to take a break from whatever activity they may be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I carried out interviews with my friends and family to see if they would be interested in a product like this.
        The outcome was very positive, they all said they would be very interested in being able to view their emotional changes towards different tasks such as movies, so I made sure to include a way to actively view the changes.
        I also asked if they would be bothered by wearing the sensor on their fingers over long periods of times, but they seemed okay with it.
        One piece of feedback that I got was that they would think it would be more useful if people could still move around while wearing it and for the artifact to not take up too much space.
        Another thing I asked that I considered when creating the code was in which way they would like to view the values.
        They wanted it to be easy to see the changes.
